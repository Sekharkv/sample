What is Responsive Web Design?

Responsive web design is nothing but creating web sites which automatically 
adjust themselves to look good on all devices, from small phones to large desktops.





Why Use Bootstrap?
==============
Advantages of Bootstrap:

Easy to use:    Anybody with just basic knowledge of HTML and CSS can start using    =========       Bootstrap.


Responsive features:    Bootstrap's responsive CSS adjusts to phones, tablets, and =================      desktops.


Mobile-first approach:      In Bootstrap, mobile-first styles are part of the core                             framework
=================

Browser compatibility:       Bootstrap  is compatible with all modern browsers ==================         (Chrome,  Firefox, Internet Explorer  10+, Edge,                              Safari, and Opera)


how we get bootstrap lines code 
----------------   ------------    -------------
1. goto w3schools.com
2. goto bootstrap
3. select any one concept like tables concept
4. click on "Try It Yourself"
5. copy all lines which are inside <head> tag
6. past all the bootstrap lines in our example inside <head> tag.


Example :
=====
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css">

  <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>

  <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.7/umd/popper.min.js"></script>

  <script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>





Create First Web Page With Bootstrap :
================================

1. Add the HTML5 doctype
----------------------------------
Bootstrap  uses HTML elements and CSS properties that require the HTML5 doctype.

Always include the HTML5 doctype at the beginning of the page, along with the lang attribute and the correct character set:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8"> 
  </head>
</html>


2. Bootstrap  is mobile-first
------------------------------------------
To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming, add the following <meta> tag inside the
 <head> element:

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

here,
The  width=device-width   part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).

The initial-scale=1 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.


3. Containers
-------------------
Bootstrap  also requires a containing element to wrap site contents.

There are two types of container classes to choose from:

The  .container    class provides a responsive fixed width container

The  .container-fluid     class provides a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport




Text Colors
=======
Bootstrap  has some contextual classes that can be used to provide "meaning through colors".

The classes for text colors are:  .text-primary, .text-success, .text-info, .text-warning, .text-danger,

ex:
---
<p class="text-success">hello</p>



Background Colors
============
The classes for background colors are: .bg-primary, .bg-success, .bg-info, .bg-warning, .bg-danger, .bg-secondary, .bg-dark and .bg-light.

Note that background colors do not set the text color, 

ex:
----
<p class="bg-success">hello</p>
